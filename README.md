My solutions in ruby to Project Euler

11 ## Greatest product of four adjacent numbers

Take a matrix grid of 20x20
2 nested loops for :
take products of horizontal cells
take products of vertical cells
take products of diagonal-up cells
take products of diagonal-down cells
find the highest

12 ## Triangle Number

function to find the total number of divisors.
Here is the algo
24 = 2^3 * 3^1
n =  (3+1) * (1 + 1) = 8
Loop through the triangles to find the number whose n > 500

13 ## Large Sum

Loop through numbers to find the large sum.
Fortunately ruby handles all the Big Numbers
